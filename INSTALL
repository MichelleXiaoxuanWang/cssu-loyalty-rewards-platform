INSTALL: This document should include a detailed description of any preparation needed for your code to run in a new environment. Include:
- Prerequisite packages to install.
- How to set up the backend and frontend.
- Information on how to deploy your website.
  - The backend server can run on the same (virtual) machine as the web server for the frontend, and is preferred for simplicity.
  - Note: You do not have to share credentials for the hosting space, but you should outline the environment (e.g., a machine running Ubuntu 20.04).

# Prerequisite packages to install
## Backend
All dependencies are listed in the `backend/package.json` file:
```
"dependencies": {
    "@prisma/client": "^6.4.1",
    "bcrypt": "^5.1.1",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "dotenv": "^16.4.7",
    "express": "^4.21.2",
    "express-jwt": "^8.5.1",
    "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2",
    "multer": "^1.4.5-lts.1",
    "nodemon": "^3.1.9",
    "prisma": "^6.4.1",
    "sqlite3": "^5.1.7",
    "uuid": "^11.1.0",
    "zod": "^3.24.2"
  }
```

 Specifically, the following packages are required:
 - @prisma/client
 - bcrypt
 - cors

 - express
 - express-jwt
 - jsonwebtoken
 - multer
 - nodemon

## Development
### Backend

1. navigate to the `backend` directory. 
    ```
    cd backend
    ```
2. [Optional but recommended] create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory, as shown in the `.env.example` file. You can specify the port and client URL as you wish. For example,
    ```
    PORT=8000
    CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
    ```
3. install the dependencies, and start the server:
    ```
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
4. You can now access the backend server at `http://localhost:8000`, where 8000 should be replaced by the port you specified in the `.env` file, and the server will accept requests coming from the client URL you specified in the `.env` file. 
   - If you did not specify the `.env` file, the server will run on port 8000 and accept requests coming from `http://localhost:3000` by default. 
   - Any changes you make to the backend code will be reflected automatically without having to restart the server.

### Frontend

1. navigate to the `frontend` directory. 
    ```
    cd frontend
    ```
